In event-driven architecture, microservices do not need to actively subscribe to external messages, but can instead centralize all entries that trigger changes in the microservice system to the API, and only need to focus on the current microservice\'s own business domain model definition and design of the API, without having to adapt and parse external service messages through a lot of glue code. EventBridge is responsible for safely and reliably adapting and delivering external service-generated events to the API designed by the current microservice.","sidebar":"myAutogeneratedSidebar"},"eventbridge/27RocketMQEventBridgeQuickStart":{"id":"eventbridge/27RocketMQEventBridgeQuickStart","title":"RocketMQ EventBridge Quick Start","description":"RocketMQ EventBridge requires a message service to store events and a runtime to subscribe and push events.

In recent years, we have seen the explosive growth of IoT device-oriented news arising from smart home and industrial interconnection, and the news on the mobile APP side of the mobile Internet, which has been developed for more than ten years, is still orders of magnitude huge. The order of magnitude of messages for terminal devices is many orders of magnitude larger than that of traditional servers and is still growing rapidly.","sidebar":"myAutogeneratedSidebar"},"iot/34RocketMQMQTTQuickStart":{"id":"iot/34RocketMQMQTTQuickStart","title":"34RocketMQMQTTQuickStart","description":"System Requirements","sidebar":"myAutogeneratedSidebar"},"parameterConfiguration/23local":{"id":"parameterConfiguration/23local","title":"\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u914d\u7f6e","description":"\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8eRocketMQ\u7684Broker\u96c6\u7fa4\uff0c\u751f\u4ea7\u8005\u548c\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u90fd\u662f\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u3002\u672c\u5c0f\u8282\u4e3b\u8981\u63cf\u8ff0\u751f\u4ea7\u8005\u548c\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u516c\u5171\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u914d\u7f6e\u3002","sidebar":"myAutogeneratedSidebar"},"parameterConfiguration/24server":{"id":"parameterConfiguration/24server","title":"\u670d\u52a1\u7aef\u914d\u7f6e","description":"NameServer\u914d\u7f6e","sidebar":"myAutogeneratedSidebar"},"producer/04concept1":{"id":"producer/04concept1","title":"Core Concept","description":"Introduction to the basic concepts of the Producer section, including Message, Tag, Keys, Message Queue and Producer.","sidebar":"myAutogeneratedSidebar"},"producer/05message1":{"id":"producer/05message1","title":"Simple Message Sending","description":"1.Creating Topic in Cluster","sidebar":"myAutogeneratedSidebar"},"producer/06message2":{"id":"producer/06message2","title":"Ordered Message Sending","description":"Ordered Message Introduction","sidebar":"myAutogeneratedSidebar"},"producer/07message3":{"id":"producer/07message3","title":"Delayed Message Sending","description":"The delayed message sending means that when a message is sent to Apache RocketMQ, instead of delivering the message immediately, it would be delivered to the Consumer for consumption after delaying a certain period of time.","sidebar":"myAutogeneratedSidebar"},"producer/08message4":{"id":"producer/08message4","title":"Batch Message Sending","description":"In the case of certain requirements on throughput, Apache RocketMQ can send messages after grouping them into batches.
